# Feature Specification: Project Foundation Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-setup-tasks-set`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Setup Tasks
[ ] Set up project repository structure (data/, notebooks/, src/, models/, docs/)
[ ] Configure Python environment with conda/environment.yml
[ ] Install core dependencies (PyTorch, OpenCV, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
[ ] Set up data directory structure for stats, videos, and commentary
[ ] Create initial Jupyter notebook templates
[ ] Set up Git LFS for large video/model files
[ ] Configure GPU environment (RTX 3090 optimization)
[ ] Create data ingestion scripts for UFCStats scraping
[ ] Set up video preprocessing pipeline (normalization, segmentation)
[ ] Create initial documentation and README"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature focuses on project infrastructure and development environment setup
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: repository structure, Python environment, ML dependencies, data pipelines, GPU optimization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All setup requirements clearly specified in task list
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Success measured by functional development environment and working data pipelines
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focuses on development infrastructure capabilities
6. Identify Key Data & Models (if ML/analytics involved)
   → Foundation for future ML model development and data processing
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Infrastructure setup specification complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines for MMA Analytics
- ✅ Focus on WHAT insights coaches need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no model architectures, specific algorithms)
- 🥊 Written for MMA coaches/analysts, not ML engineers
- 📊 Include measurable success criteria (accuracy, precision, speed)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation - MMA Domain Focus
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption
2. **Think like a coach**: What would a fight analyst need to validate this works?
3. **Performance targets**: Every ML feature needs accuracy/precision/speed requirements
4. **Common underspecified areas in MMA analytics**:
   - Strike classification precision requirements
   - Video processing speed constraints  
   - Model accuracy thresholds
   - Data privacy/licensing constraints
   - Integration with existing fight analysis workflows
   - Output format preferences (clips, reports, data exports)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an MMA analytics developer, I need a fully configured development environment with proper data structures and dependencies so I can begin building machine learning models for fight analysis without infrastructure obstacles.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh repository clone, **When** environment setup is complete, **Then** all Python dependencies install successfully and GPU is detected
2. **Given** the configured environment, **When** data ingestion scripts are run, **Then** UFCStats data is successfully scraped and stored in proper directory structure
3. **Given** video files are placed in data directory, **When** preprocessing pipeline is executed, **Then** videos are normalized and segmented for analysis

### Success Criteria
- **Environment Target**: Python environment builds successfully with all ML dependencies on RTX 3090
- **Data Pipeline Target**: UFCStats scraping retrieves complete fighter/bout data within 5 minutes
- **Storage Target**: Git LFS properly handles video files >100MB without repository bloat
- **Processing Target**: Video preprocessing handles UFC broadcast format (720p/1080p MP4) without errors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when UFCStats website structure changes?
- How does system handle corrupted or incomplete video files?
- What if GPU memory is insufficient for large video processing?
- How does environment handle dependency conflicts between ML frameworks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Development environment MUST support PyTorch, OpenCV, pandas, and scikit-learn with GPU acceleration on RTX 3090
- **FR-002**: Repository structure MUST organize data/, notebooks/, src/, models/, and docs/ directories for clear separation of concerns
- **FR-003**: Data ingestion MUST successfully scrape UFCStats for fighter statistics, bout results, and historical data
- **FR-004**: Video preprocessing pipeline MUST normalize UFC broadcast videos and segment into analyzable clips
- **FR-005**: Git LFS MUST handle large video files and trained models without impacting repository performance
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST provide clear setup instructions for new developers joining the project

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Environment setup MUST complete within 15 minutes on modern development machine
- **PR-002**: GPU optimization MUST utilize RTX 3090 memory efficiently (≥12GB utilization for video processing)
- **PR-003**: Data scraping MUST complete full UFCStats historical data retrieval within 30 minutes

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: System MUST organize fight videos by event, date, and weight class in hierarchical directory structure
- **DR-002**: System MUST store fighter statistics in structured format (JSON/CSV) for ML model consumption
- **DR-003**: System MUST maintain local data storage without external cloud dependencies for privacy
- **DR-004**: System MUST handle UFC broadcast video formats (MP4, 720p-4K resolution, 25-30 FPS)

### Key Data & Models *(include if ML/analytics involved)*
- **Repository Structure**: Organized directories for data storage, model development, and analysis notebooks
- **UFC Statistics Data**: Fighter records, bout outcomes, striking statistics from UFCStats.com
- **Video Data Pipeline**: Preprocessing infrastructure for normalizing and segmenting fight footage for future analysis
- **Development Environment**: GPU-optimized Python environment with ML/computer vision dependencies configured
