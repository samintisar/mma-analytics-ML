# Overview  
The Project Setup & Data Infrastructure milestone establishes the foundational framework for the UFC Video + Stats Analytics project. This milestone addresses the critical need for a robust, scalable development environment that can handle complex machine learning workflows involving video processing, statistical analysis, and data management. It solves the problem of inefficient project initialization and data handling that often plagues ML projects, particularly those dealing with large multimedia datasets. This milestone is valuable for data scientists, ML engineers, and MMA analysts who need a reliable platform to build advanced analytics tools for combat sports.

# Core Features  
- **Project Repository Structure**: Organizes the codebase into logical directories (data/, notebooks/, src/, models/, docs/) for maintainability and collaboration. This feature ensures clean separation of concerns and makes the project easier to navigate and contribute to.
- **Python Environment Configuration**: Sets up a reproducible conda environment with all necessary dependencies. This ensures consistent development across different machines and prevents dependency conflicts.
- **Data Directory Structure**: Creates organized storage for stats, videos, and commentary data with proper versioning and backup mechanisms. This feature enables efficient data management and retrieval for large-scale analytics.
- **Jupyter Notebook Templates**: Provides standardized templates for data exploration, model development, and reporting. This accelerates development by providing starting points for common tasks.
- **Git LFS Integration**: Enables handling of large video and model files without bloating the repository. This is crucial for ML projects dealing with multimedia content.
- **GPU Environment Optimization**: Configures the RTX 3090 for optimal performance in video processing and model training tasks.
- **Data Ingestion Scripts**: Automated tools for scraping and processing UFC statistics from various sources. This feature ensures reliable data collection and preprocessing.
- **Video Preprocessing Pipeline**: Framework for normalizing and segmenting video content for analysis. This enables consistent video processing across different input formats.
- **Documentation Framework**: Comprehensive README and documentation setup for project onboarding and maintenance.

# User Experience  
The primary users are data scientists and ML engineers working on MMA analytics. The user journey begins with cloning the repository and running a single setup script that configures the entire environment. Key flows include:
1. Environment setup (conda environment creation, dependency installation)
2. Data ingestion (running scraping scripts, verifying data integrity)
3. Development workflow (using notebook templates, accessing organized data)
4. Collaboration (clear documentation, standardized structure)

UI/UX considerations focus on developer experience: clear documentation, automated setup processes, intuitive directory structure, and comprehensive error handling in scripts.

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**: Python-based ML stack with conda environment management, Git LFS for large files, Jupyter for interactive development, and GPU-accelerated computing
- **Data Models**: Structured directories for raw/processed data, model artifacts, and documentation with versioning
- **APIs and Integrations**: UFCStats API for data scraping, OpenCV/PyTorch for video processing, pandas/scikit-learn for data manipulation
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: RTX 3090 GPU, minimum 32GB RAM, 1TB storage, Python 3.8+, conda package manager

# Development Roadmap  
**Phase 1: Environment Foundation**
- Conda environment setup with base dependencies
- Project directory structure creation
- Basic documentation framework

**Phase 2: Data Infrastructure**
- Data directory structure implementation
- Git LFS configuration
- Data ingestion script development

**Phase 3: Development Tools**
- Jupyter notebook templates
- GPU environment configuration
- Video preprocessing pipeline foundation

**Phase 4: Integration & Validation**
- End-to-end data pipeline testing
- Documentation completion
- Setup automation scripts

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation Setup**: Environment and directory structure must be established first as everything else depends on it
2. **Data Infrastructure**: Data handling capabilities need to be in place before any analysis can begin
3. **Development Tools**: Interactive development environment should be ready for immediate productivity
4. **Automation**: Setup scripts should be the final step to enable easy onboarding

This chain ensures we get to a usable development environment as quickly as possible while building a solid foundation for future milestones.

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Challenges**: Complex dependency management with GPU libraries
  - Mitigation: Use conda environments with explicit version pinning, comprehensive testing on target hardware
- **Data Volume Management**: Large video files overwhelming storage/repository
  - Mitigation: Git LFS implementation, cloud storage integration planning
- **GPU Compatibility**: RTX 3090 specific optimizations may not transfer to other hardware
  - Mitigation: Abstract GPU operations, include fallback CPU implementations
- **Resource Constraints**: High hardware requirements may limit development team
  - Mitigation: Cloud GPU instance support, modular design for different hardware configurations

# Appendix  
- **Research Findings**: Conda environments provide better reproducibility than pip for ML projects
- **Technical Specifications**: Python 3.8+, CUDA 11.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, OpenCV 4.8+
- **Hardware Requirements**: RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM), 64GB RAM recommended, 2TB NVMe storage
