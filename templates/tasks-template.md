# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: ML framework, model architecture, data pipeline
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract models/data → training/inference tasks
   → contracts/: Each schema → validation test task
   → research.md: Extract ML decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by ML category:
   → Setup: environment, dependencies, data preparation
   → Tests: model validation, accuracy tests, pipeline tests
   → Core: data processing, model training, inference pipelines
   → Integration: end-to-end workflows, performance optimization
   → Polish: model tuning, documentation, deployment prep
4. Apply ML task rules:
   → Different models/data = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same training pipeline = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before training (TDD for ML)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate ML dependency graph
7. Create parallel training examples
8. Validate ML completeness:
   → All models have validation tests?
   → All data pipelines tested?
   → All accuracy thresholds specified?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Parallel Example for ML Workflows
```
# Launch independent model validation tests together:
Task: "Model contract test for strike detection accuracy ≥85% in tests/contract/test_strike_model.py"
Task: "Performance test for 25 FPS processing in tests/model/test_performance.py"
Task: "Video preprocessing validation in tests/integration/test_video_pipeline.py"

# Launch independent data processing modules:
Task: "Video normalization module in src/video/preprocessing/video_normalizer.py"
Task: "Data augmentation pipeline in src/video/preprocessing/augmentation.py"
Task: "Feature extraction module in src/video/features/pose_extractor.py"
```

## Notes for ML Development
- [P] tasks = different models/data files, no shared dependencies
- Verify model tests fail before implementing training
- Use reproducible seeds for all random operations
- Track model performance metrics throughout development
- Commit model checkpoints after significant improvements
- Include GPU memory usage in performance tests

## Task Generation Rules for ML Features
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Model Contracts**:
   - Each model schema → validation test task [P]
   - Each accuracy threshold → performance test task [P]
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each data source → preprocessing task [P]
   - Each transformation → pipeline component task [P]
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each analysis scenario → integration test [P]
   - Each output format → export task [P]

4. **ML-Specific Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Data → Models → Training → Validation → Integration
   - Independent models can train in parallel
   - Shared data dependencies block parallel execution
