# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: data sources, ML models, performance targets, outputs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear validation criteria: ERROR "Cannot determine success metrics"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must include performance/accuracy targets
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous ML requirements
6. Identify Key Data & Models (if ML/analytics involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines for MMA Analytics
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT insights coaches need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no model architectures, specific algorithms)
- ü•ä Written for MMA coaches/analysts, not ML engineers
- üìä Include measurable success criteria (accuracy, precision, speed)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation - MMA Domain Focus
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption
2. **Think like a coach**: What would a fight analyst need to validate this works?
3. **Performance targets**: Every ML feature needs accuracy/precision/speed requirements
4. **Common underspecified areas in MMA analytics**:
   - Strike classification precision requirements
   - Video processing speed constraints  
   - Model accuracy thresholds
   - Data privacy/licensing constraints
   - Integration with existing fight analysis workflows
   - Output format preferences (clips, reports, data exports)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main coach/analyst journey in plain language]
*Example: "As a fight camp analyst, I need to identify my fighter's striking vulnerabilities so I can design targeted defensive drills for the next training camp."*

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [fight video/data], **When** [analysis is run], **Then** [specific insights are generated with X% accuracy]
2. **Given** [historical data], **When** [model processes input], **Then** [predictions meet performance threshold]

### Success Criteria
- **Accuracy Target**: [e.g., Strike detection ‚â•85% precision for jab/cross/hook]
- **Speed Target**: [e.g., Process 25-30 FPS video in real-time on RTX 3090]
- **Usefulness Target**: [e.g., Coach validation ‚â•4/5 for actionable insights]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [video quality is poor/lighting changes]?
- How does system handle [unusual fighting styles/rare techniques]?
- What if [insufficient training data for new fighter]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific ML capability, e.g., "classify strikes into 7 categories with ‚â•85% precision"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [data processing capability, e.g., "process UFC broadcast video at 25-30 FPS"]  
- **FR-003**: Analysts MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "export highlight clips for each detected pattern"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [output requirement, e.g., "generate timestamped analysis reports in JSON format"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [performance requirement, e.g., "complete full fight analysis within 2x fight duration"]

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Model accuracy MUST achieve [specific threshold, e.g., "‚â•85% precision on basic strikes, ‚â•75% on advanced techniques"]
- **PR-002**: Processing speed MUST achieve [specific target, e.g., "real-time inference on RTX 3090"]
- **PR-003**: Memory usage MUST remain [within constraints, e.g., "<16GB GPU memory for full pipeline"]

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: System MUST process [data types, e.g., "UFC broadcast video files (MP4, 720p/1080p)"]
- **DR-002**: System MUST handle [data volume, e.g., "individual fights up to 25 minutes duration"]
- **DR-003**: System MUST maintain [privacy constraints, e.g., "local-only processing, no cloud uploads"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect fighter stances with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: required accuracy threshold not specified]
- **DR-004**: System MUST store training data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Data & Models *(include if ML/analytics involved)*
- **[Input Data]**: [What it represents, format, source - e.g., "UFC broadcast video: MP4 files, 25-30 FPS, single camera angle"]
- **[Training Data]**: [What's needed for model training - e.g., "Labeled strike sequences: 300-500 clips across 7 strike types"]
- **[Model Outputs]**: [What the system produces - e.g., "Timestamped strike events with confidence scores and bounding boxes"]
